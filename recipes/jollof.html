    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      The dish is typically made with long-grain rice, tomatoes, chilies,
      onions, spices, and sometimes other vegetables and/or meat in a single
      pot, although its ingredients and preparation methods vary across
      different regions.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup oil (vegetable/canola/coconut, not olive
        oil)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>6</strong> medium-sized fresh plum/Roma tomatoes, chopped, OR a
        400-gram tin of tomatoes
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>6</strong> fresh, red poblano peppers (or 4 large red bell
        peppers), seeds discarded
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>3</strong> medium-sized red onions (1 sliced thinly, 2 roughly
        chopped), divided
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a blender, combine tomatoes, red poblano (or bell) peppers, chopped
        onions, and Scotch bonnets with 2 cups of stock, blend till smooth,
        about a minute or two. You should have roughly 6 cups of blended mix.
        Pour into a large pot/ pan and bring to the boil then turn down and let
        simmer, partly covered for 10 - 12 minutes
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large pan, heat oil and add the sliced onions. Season with a pinch
        of salt, stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes, then add the bay leaves, curry
        powder and dried thyme and a pinch of black pepper for 3 - 4 minutes on
        medium heat. Then add the tomato paste - stir for another 2 minutes. Add
        the reduced tomato-pepper-Scotch bonnet mixture, stir, and set on medium
        heat for 10 to 12 minutes till reduced by half, with the lid partly on.
        This is the stew that will define the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 4 cups of the stock to the cooked tomato sauce and bring it to boil
        for 1 - 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the rinsed rice and butter, stir, cover with a double piece of
        foil/baking or parchment paper and put a lid on the pan—this will seal
        in the steam and lock in the flavor. Turn down the heat and cook on the
        lowest possible heat for 30 minutes, stirring half way through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir rice—taste and adjust as required. If rice isn't soft enough/ needs
        additional cooking, add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of stock or water, stir through
        and continue to steam, on low till cooked through.
      </li>
    </ol>
